I'm trying my best here...

Goals for website:
- Has basic calendar.
- Bar at top, includes basic info (pns, sp, gi)
- Links to linktree and others
- Maybe an rocket launch tracking kind of thing? Not sure yet. (i have the code in python i just don't know how to port it into js yet)
- Interests page, more advanced details.
- Contact page embedded via GForms for no bots stealing
- Bunch of embeds for stats on typing, chess and such
